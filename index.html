  <h1>Daily Morning Prayer</h1>

  <p><em>Approved for Provincial Use </em></p>

  <h3>The Anglican Church in North America</h3>

  <p><em>Petertide, A.D. 2013</em></p>
</div>


<p><em class='reader-notes'>The Officiant may begin Morning Prayer by reading an opening sentence of Scripture found on pages 11-12 or another appropriate Scripture. The Confession of Sin may be said, or the Office may continue with &ldquo;O Lord, open our lips.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>

<p class='note'>The Officiant says to the People</p>

<p>Dearly beloved, the Scriptures teach us to acknowledge our many sins and offenses, not concealing them from our heavenly Father, but confessing them with humble and obedient hearts that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy. We ought at all times humbly to acknowledge our sins before Almighty God, but especially when we come together in his presence to give thanks for the great benefits we have received at his hands, to declare his most worthy praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and others, those things necessary for our life and our salvation. Therefore, come with me to the throne of heavenly grace.</p>

<p class='note'>or this</p>

<p>Let us humbly confess our sins to Almighty God.</p>

<p class='note'>Silence is kept. All kneeling the Officiant and People say</p>

<p class='hanging-indent'>
  <span>Almighty and most merciful Father,</span> 
  <span>we have erred and strayed from your ways like lost sheep. </span>
  <span>we have followed too much the deceits and desires of our own hearts. </span>
  <span>we have offended against your holy laws. </span>
  <span>we have left undone those things which we ought to have done, </span>
  <span>and we have done those things which we ought not to have done; </span>
  <span>and apart from your grace, there is no health in us. </span>
  <span>O Lord, have mercy upon us. </span>
  <span>Spare those who confess their faults. </span>
  <span>Restore those who are penitent, according to your promises declared to all people in Christ Jesus our Lord; </span>
  <span>And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake, that we may now live a godly, righteous, and sober life, to the glory of your holy Name. Amen.</span>
</p>

<p class='note'>The Priest alone stands and says</p>

<p>Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, desires not the death of sinners, but that they may turn from their wickedness and live. He has empowered and commanded his ministers to pronounce to his people, being penitent, the absolution and remission of their sins. He pardons all who truly repent and genuinely believe his holy Gospel. For this reason, we beseech him to grant us true repentance and his Holy Spirit, that our present deeds may please him, the rest of our lives may be pure and holy, and that at the last we may come to his eternal joy; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class='note'>or this</p>

<p>The Almighty and merciful Lord grant you absolution and remission of all your sins, true repentance, amendment of life, and the grace and consolation of his Holy Spirit. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class='note'>A deacon or layperson remains kneeling and prays</p>

<p>Grant your faithful people, merciful Lord, pardon and peace; that we may be cleansed from all our sins, and serve you with a quiet mind; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em> </p>

<h3>The Invitatory</h3>

<p class='note'>All stand. </p>

<p class='note'>Then follows the Venite. Alternatively, the Jubilate may be used. </p>

<p class='note'>These seasonal antiphons may be sung or said before and after the Invitatory Psalm.</p>

<h4>Advent</h4>

<p>Our King and Savior now draws near: O come, let us adore him.</p>

<h4>Christmas</h4>

<p>Alleluia, to us a child is born: O come, let us adore him. Alleluia.</p>

<h4>Epiphany through the Baptism of Christ and the Transfiguration</h4>

<p>The Lord has shown forth his glory: O come, let us adore him.</p>

<h4>Lent</h4>

<p>The Lord is full of compassion and mercy: O come, let us adore him.</p>

<h4>Easter until Ascension</h4>

<p>Alleluia. The Lord is risen indeed: O come, let us adore him. Alleluia.</p>

<h4>Ascension until Pentecost</h4>

<p>Alleluia. Christ the Lord has ascended into heaven: O come, let us adore him. Alleluia.</p>

<h4>Pentecost and the week following</h4>

<p>Alleluia. The Spirit of the Lord renews the face of the earth: O come, let us adore him. Alleluia.</p>

<h4>Trinity Sunday</h4>

<p>Father, Son and Holy Spirit, one God: O come, let us adore him.</p>

<h4>On feasts of the Incarnation</h4>

<p>The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us: O come, let us adore him.
</p>

<h4>On All Saints and other major saints&rsquo; days</h4>

<p>The Lord is glorious in his saints: O come, let us adore him. </p>


<h3 class='song'>Venite <span>O Come</span></h3> 

<p class='scripture-reference'>Psalm 95:1-7; 8-11</p>

<p class='hanging-indent'>
  <span>O come, let us sing to the Lord; </span>
  <span>Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation! </span>
  <span>Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; </span>
  <span>Let us make a joyful noise to him with songs of praise! </span>
  <span>For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods. </span>
  <span>In his hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also.</span> 
  <span>The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land. </span>
  <span>O come, let us worship and bow down; Let us kneel before the Lord, our Maker! </span>
  <span>For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.</span>
  <span>O, that today you would hearken to his voice!</span>
</p>

<p class='note'>In Lent, and on other penitential occasions, the following verses are added.</p>

<p>Do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah, as on the day at Massah in the wilderness, when your fathers put me to the test and put me to the proof, though they had seen my work. <br>For forty years I loathed that generation and said, &ldquo;They are a people who go astray in their heart, and they have not known my ways.&rdquo; <br>Therefore I swore in my wrath, &ldquo;They shall not enter my rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p class='note'>or this</p>

<h3 class='song'>Jubilate <span>Be Joyful</span></h3> 

<p class='scripture-reference'>Psalm 100</p>

<p class='hanging-indent'>
  <span>Be joyful in the Lord, all you lands; serve the Lord with gladness and come before his presence with a song.</span> 
  <span>Know this: the Lord himself is God; he himself has made us, and we are his; we are his people and the sheep of his pasture. </span>
  <span>Enter his gates with thanksgiving; go into his courts with praise; give thanks to him and call upon his Name. </span>
  <span>For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his faithfulness endures from age to age.</span>
</p>

<p class='note'>During the first week of Easter, the Pascha Nostrum will be used in place of the Invitatory Psalm. It is appropriate to use this canticle throughout Eastertide.</p>

<h3 class='song'>Pascha Nostrum <span>Christ our Passover</span></h3>

<p class='scripture-reference'>1 Corinthians 5:7-8; Romans 6:9-11; 1 Corinthians 15:20-22</p>

<p class='hanging-indent'>
  <span>Alleluia. Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us; therefore let us keep the feast, </span>
  <span>not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Halleluiah. Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.</span> 
  <span>The death that he died, he died to sin, once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.</span>
  <span>So also consider yourselves dead to sin, and alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. Alleluia.</span>
  <span>Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</span>
  <span>For since by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</span>
  <span>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. Alleluia.</span>
</p>

<p class='note'>Then follows</p>

<h3>The Psalm or Psalms Appointed</h3>

<p class='note'>At the end of the Psalms is sung or said</p>

<p class='hanging-indent'>
  <span>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</span>

<p class='note'>The following Canticles are normally sung or said after each of the lessons. The Officiant may also use a Canticle drawn from those on pages 2531or an appropriate song of praise.</p>

<h3 class='song'>Te Deum Laudamus <span>We Praise You, O God</span></h3>

<p class='hanging-indent'>
  <span>We praise you, O God, we acclaim you as Lord; all creation worships you, the Father everlasting. </span>
  <span>To you all angels, all the powers of heaven, </span>
  <span>The cherubim and seraphim, sing in endless praise: Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of power and might, heaven and earth are full of your glory. </span>
  <span>The glorious company of apostles praise you. </span>
  <span>The noble fellowship of prophets praise you. </span>
  <span>The white-robed army of martyrs praise you.</span>
  <span>Throughout the world the holy Church acclaims you: Father, of majesty unbounded, your true and only Son, worthy of all praise, the Holy Spirit, advocate and guide. </span>
  <span>You, Christ, are the king of glory, the eternal Son of the Father. </span>
  <span>When you took our flesh to set us free you humbly chose the Virgin&rsquo;s womb. </span>
  <span>You overcame the sting of death and opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers. </span>
  <span>You are seated at God&rsquo;s right hand in glory. We believe that you will come to be our judge. </span>
  <span>Come then, Lord, and help your people, bought with the price of your own blood, and bring us with your saints to glory everlasting. </span>
  <span>Save your people, Lord, and bless your inheritance; govern and uphold them now and always. </span>
  <span>Day by day we bless you; we praise your name forever. </span>
  <span>Keep us today, Lord, from all sin; have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy. </span>
  <span>Lord, show us your love and mercy, for we have put our trust in you. </span>
  <span>In you, Lord, is our hope, let us never be put to shame.</span>
</p>

<p class='note'>During Lent the Benedictus es, Domine usually replaces the Te Deum. The Benedictus es, Domine may be used at other times as well.</p>

<h3 class='song'>Benedictus es, Domine <span>A Song of Praise</span></h3>

<p class='scripture-reference'>Song of the Three Young Men, 29-34</p>


<p class='hanging-indent'>
  <span>Glory to you, Lord God of our fathers; you are worthy of praise; glory to you. </span>
  <span>Glory to you for the radiance of your holy Name; we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever. </span>
  <span>Glory to you in the splendor of your temple; on the throne of your majesty, glory to you. </span>
  <span>Glory to you, seated between the Cherubim; we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever. </span>
  <span>Glory to you, beholding the depths; in the high vault of heaven, glory to you.</span>
  <span>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; we will praise you and highly exalt you for ever. </span>
</p>

<h3 class='song'>Benedictus <span>The Song of Zechariah</span></h3>

<p class='scripture-reference'>Luke 1:68-79</p>

<p class='hanging-indent'>
  <span>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; he has come to his people and set them free. </span>
  <span>He has raised up for us a mighty savior, born of the house of his servant David.</span>
  <span>Through his holy prophets he promised of old, </span>
  <span>that he would save us from our enemies, from the hands of all who hate us. </span>
  <span>He promised to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant. </span>
  <span>This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham, to set us free from the hands of our enemies, </span>
  <span>Free to worship him without fear, holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our life. </span>
  <span>You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way, </span>
  <span>To give his people knowledge of salvation by the forgiveness of their sins. </span>
  <span>In the tender compassion of our God the dawn from on high shall break upon us, </span>
  <span>To shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death, and to guide our feet into the way of peace. </span>
  <span>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</span>
</p>

<p class='note'>If desired, a sermon on the Morning Lessons may be preached.</p>

<h3>The Apostles&rsquo; Creed</h3>

<p class='note'>Officiant and People together, all standing</p>

<p class='hanging-indent'>
  <span>I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth. </span>
  <span>I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again. He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</span> 
  <span>I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.</span>

<p class='note'>The Officiant then prays one or more of the following collects. It is traditional to pray the Collects for Peace and Grace daily. Alternatively, one may pray the collects on a weekly rotation, using the suggestions in parentheses.</p>

<p>The Collect of the Day </p>

<p>A Collect for Strength to Await Christ&rsquo;s Return (Sunday) </p>

O God our King, by the resurrection of your Son Jesus Christ on the first day of the week, you conquered sin, put death to flight, and gave us the hope of everlasting life: Redeem all our days by this victory; forgive our sins, banish our fears, make us bold to praise you and to do your will; and steel us to wait for the consummation of your kingdom on the last great Day; through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em> 

<p>A Collect for the Renewal of Life (Monday) </p>

<p>O God, the King eternal, whose light divides the day from the night and turns the shadow of death into the morning: Drive far from us all wrong desires, incline our hearts to keep your law, and guide our feet into the way of peace; that, having done your will with cheerfulness during the day, we may, when night comes, rejoice to give you thanks; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p> 

<p>A Collect for Peace (Tuesday) </p>

<p>O God, the author of peace and lover of concord, to know you is eternal life and to serve you is perfect freedom: Defend us, your humble servants, in all assaults of our enemies; that we, surely trusting in your defense, may not fear the power of any adversaries, through the might of Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

 <p>A Collect for Grace (Wednesday) </p>

 <p>O Lord, our heavenly Father, almighty and everlasting God, you have brought us safely to the beginning of this day: Defend us by your mighty power, that we may not fall into sin nor run into any danger; and that guided by your Spirit, we may do what is righteous in your sight; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p>A Collect for Guidance (Thursday) </p>

<p>Heavenly Father, in you we live and move and have our being: We humbly pray you so to guide and govern us by your Holy Spirit, that in all the cares and occupations of our life we may not forget you, but may remember that we are ever walking in your sight; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p> 

<p>A Collect for Endurance (Friday) </p>

<p>Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he was crucified: Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way of the cross, may find it none other than the way of life and peace; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord. <em>Amen.</em> </p>

<p>A Collect for Sabbath Rest (Saturday) </p>

<p>Almighty God, who after the creation of the world rested from all your works and sanctified a day of rest for all your creatures: Grant that we, putting away all earthly anxieties, may be duly prepared for the service of your sanctuary, and that our rest here upon earth may be a preparation for the eternal rest promised to your people in heaven; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class='note'>Unless The Great Litany or the Eucharist is to follow, one of the following prayers for mission is added.</p>

<p>Almighty and everlasting God, who alone works great marvels: Send down upon our clergy and the congregations committed to their charge the life-giving Spirit of your grace, shower them with the continual dew of your blessing, and ignite in them a zealous love of your Gospel, through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p> 

<p>O God, you have made of one blood all the peoples of the earth, and sent your blessed Son to preach peace to those who are far off and to those who are near: Grant that people everywhere may seek after you and find you; bring the nations into your fold; pour out your Spirit upon all flesh; and hasten the coming of your kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p> 

<p>Lord Jesus Christ, you stretched out your arms of love on the hard wood of the cross that everyone might come within the reach of your saving embrace: So clothe us in your Spirit that we, reaching forth our hands in love, may bring those who do not know you to the knowledge and love of you; for the honor of your Name. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class='note'>Here may be sung a hymn or anthem. </p>

<p class='note'>The Officiant may invite the People to offer intercessions and thanksgivings. </p>

<p class='note'>Before the close of the Office one or both of the following may be used.</p>

<h3>The General Thanksgiving</h3>

<p class='note'>Officiant and People</p>

<p class='hanging-indent'>
  <span>Almighty God, Father of all mercies, </span>
  <span>we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks </span>
  <span>for all your goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all whom you have made. </span>
  <span>We bless you for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life; </span>
  <span>but above all for your immeasurable love </span>
  <span>in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ; </span>
  <span>for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory. </span>
  <span>And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies, </span>
  <span>that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise, </span>
  <span>not only with our lips, but in our lives, </span>
  <span>by giving up our selves to your service, </span>
  <span>and by walking before you in holiness and righteousness all our days; </span>
  <span>through Jesus Christ our Lord, </span>
  <span>to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, </span>
  <span>be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen. </span>
</p>

<h3>A Prayer of St. John Chrysostom </h3>

<p>Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplications to you; and you have promised through your well beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his name you will be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. <em>Amen.</em></p>

  <p><em>Approved for Provincial Use </em></p>

  <h3>The Anglican Church in North America</h3>

  <p><em>Petertide, A.D. 2013</em></p>
</div>

<p class='note'>The Officiant may begin Evening Prayer by reading an opening sentence of Scripture found on pages 22-23or another appropriate Scripture. The Confession of Sin may be said, or the Office may continue with &ldquo;O Lord, open our lips.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Confession of Sin</h3>
<p class='note'>The Officiant says to the People</p>

<p>Dearly beloved, the Scriptures teach us to acknowledge our many sins and offenses, not concealing them from our heavenly Father, but confessing them with humble and obedient hearts that we may obtain forgiveness by his infinite goodness and mercy. We ought at all times humbly to acknowledge our sins before Almighty God, but especially when we come together in his presence to give thanks for the great benefits we have received at his hands, to declare his most worthy praise, to hear his holy Word, and to ask, for ourselves and others, those things necessary for our life and our salvation. Therefore, come with me to the throne of heavenly grace.</p>

<p class='note'>or this</p>

<p>Let us humbly confess our sins to Almighty God.</p>

<p>Silence is kept. All kneeling the Officiant and People say</p>

<p class='hanging-indent'>
  <span>Almighty and most merciful Father,</span> 
  <span>we have erred and strayed from your ways like lost sheep. </span>
  <span>we have followed too much the deceits and desires of our own hearts. </span>
  <span>we have offended against your holy laws. </span>
  <span>we have left undone those things which we ought to have done, </span>
  <span>and we have done those things which we ought not to have done; </span>
  <span>and apart from your grace, there is no health in us. </span>
  <span>O Lord, have mercy upon us. </span>
  <span>Spare those who confess their faults. </span>
  <span>Restore those who are penitent, according to your promises declared to all people in Christ Jesus our Lord; </span>
  <span>And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake, that we may now live a godly, righteous, and sober life, to the glory of your holy Name. Amen.</span>
</p>


<p class='note'>The Priest alone stands and says</p>

<p>Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, desires not the death of sinners, but that they may turn from their wickedness and live. He has empowered and commanded his ministers to pronounce to his people, being penitent, the absolution and remission of their sins. He pardons all who truly repent and genuinely believe his holy Gospel. For this reason, we beseech him to grant us true repentance and his Holy Spirit, that our present deeds may please him, the rest of our lives may be pure and holy, and that at the last we may come to his eternal joy; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class='note'>or this</p>

<p>The Almighty and merciful Lord grant you absolution and remission of all your sins, true repentance, amendment of life, and the grace and consolation of his Holy Spirit. <p class='note'>Amen.</p></p>

<p class='note'>A deacon or layperson remains kneeling and prays</p>

<p>Grant your faithful people, merciful Lord, pardon and peace; that we may be cleansed from all our sins, and serve you with a quiet mind; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<h3 class=''>Magnificat <span>The Song of Mary</span></h3>
<p class='scripture-reference'>Luke 1:46-55</p>

<p class='hanging-indent'>
  <span>My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior. </span>
  <span>For he has regarded the lowliness of his handmaiden. For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed. </span>
  <span>For he that is mighty has magnified me, and holy is his Name. </span>
  <span>And his mercy is on those who fear him, throughout all generations. </span>
  <span>He has shown the strength of his arm; he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. </span>
  <span>He has brought down the mighty from their thrones, and has exalted the humble and meek. </span>
  <span>He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent empty away. </span>
  <span>He, remembering his mercy, has helped his servant Israel, as he promised to our fathers, Abraham and his seed forever. </span>
  <span>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</span>

<h3 class='song'>Nunc dimittis <span>The Song of Simeon</span></h3>

  <span>I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth. </span>
  <span>I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again. He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</span>

<p class='note'>The Officiant then prays one or more of the following collects. It is traditional to pray the Collects for Peace and Grace daily. Alternatively, one may pray the collects on a weekly rotation, using the suggestions in parentheses.</p>


<p>The Collect of the Day </p>

<p>A Collect for Resurrection Hope (Sunday)</p>

<p>Lord God, whose Son our Savior Jesus Christ triumphed over the powers of death and prepared for us our place in the new Jerusalem: Grant that we, who have this day given thanks for his resurrection, may praise you in that City of which he is the light, and where he lives and reigns forever and ever. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p>A Collect for Peace (Monday) </p>

O God, the source of all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works: Give to your servants that peace which the world cannot <p>give, that our hearts may be set to obey your commandments, and that we, being defended from the fear of our enemies, may pass our time in rest and quietness, through the merits of Jesus Christ our Savior. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p>A Collect for Aid against Perils (Tuesday)</p>
<p>Lighten our darkness, we beseech you, O Lord; and by your great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night; for the love of your only Son, our Savior Jesus Christ. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p>A Collect for Protection (Wednesday) </p>

<p>O God, the life of all who live, the light of the faithful, the strength of those who labor, and the repose of the dead: We thank you for the blessings of the day that is past, and humbly ask for your protection through the coming night. Bring us in safety to the morning hours; through him who died and rose again for us, your Son our Savior Jesus Christ. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p>A Collect for the Presence of Christ (Thursday) </p>

<p>Lord Jesus, stay with us, for evening is at hand and the day is past; be our companion in the way, kindle our hearts, and awaken hope, that we may know you as you are revealed in Scripture and the breaking of bread. Grant this for the sake of your love. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p>A Collect for Faith (Friday)</p>

 <p>Lord Jesus Christ, by your death you took away the sting of death: Grant to us your servants so to follow in faith where you have led the way, that we may at length fall asleep peacefully in you and wake up in your likeness; for your tender mercies&rsquo; sake. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p>A Collect for the Eve of Worship (Saturday)</p>

<p>O God, the source of eternal light: Shed forth your unending day upon us who watch for you, that our lips may praise you, our lives may bless you, and our worship on the morrow give you glory; through Jesus Christ our Lord. <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class='note'>Unless the Eucharist is to follow, one of the following prayers for mission is added.</p>

<p>O God and Father of all, whom the whole heavens adore: Let the whole earth also worship you, all nations obey you, all tongues confess and bless you, and men, women and children everywhere love you and serve you in peace; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

<p>Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or weep this night, and give your angels charge over those who sleep. Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless the dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the joyous; and all for your love&rsquo;s sake. Amen.</p>

<p>O God, you manifest in your servants the signs of your presence: Send forth upon us the Spirit of love, that in companionship with one another your abounding grace may increase among us; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

  <span>we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks </span>
  <span>for all your goodness and loving-kindness to us and to all whom you have made. </span>
  <span>We bless you for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life; </span>
  <span>but above all for your immeasurable love </span>
  <span>in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ; </span>
  <span>for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory. </span>
  <span>And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies, </span>
  <span>that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise, </span>
  <span>not only with our lips, but in our lives, </span>
  <span>by giving up our selves to your service, </span>
  <span>and by walking before you in holiness and righteousness all our days; </span>
  <span>through Jesus Christ our Lord, </span>
  <span>to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit, </span>
  <span>be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen. </span>
</p>

<h3>A Prayer of St. John Chrysostom </h3>

<p>Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one accord to make our common supplications to you; and you have promised through your well beloved Son that when two or three are gathered together in his name you will be in the midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. <em>Amen.</em></p>
